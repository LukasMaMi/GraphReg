Description: The new stability-based selection methods introduced in the master's project: 
    "GraphReg: An Extended Stability Approach to Regularization Selection in Sparse Graphical Models" 
    project are implemented in the GraphReg function. This function, developed specifically for the project, 
    builds upon the pulsar function from the R-package ”Pulsar” ([1]), created by the authors of G-StARS ([2]).
